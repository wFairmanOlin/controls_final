    "We are modeling a permanent magnet floating beneath an electromagnet. The input to our system is the voltage across our electromagnet and the output of the system is the distance between the electromagnet and the permanent magnet. The goal is to keep the output of the system at a steady value between $0$ and $\\infty$. The system also contains a hall effect to measure the magnetic field. The external forces acting on our permanent magnet are shown below. The only forces acting on our circuit is the force of gravity and the force between the permanent magnet and electromagnet.\n",
