    "We are modeling a permanent magnet floating beneath an electromagnet. The input to our system is the desired position for the permanent magnet relative to our electromagnet and the output of the system is the actual position. The goal is to keep the output of the system at a steady value between $0$ and $\\infty$. The system also contains a hall effect sensor to measure the magnetic field. The external forces acting on our permanent magnet are shown below. The only forces acting on our magnet is the force of gravity and the force between the permanent magnet and electromagnet.\n",
